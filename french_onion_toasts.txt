French Onion Toasts

Adapted from Smitten Kitchen
Makes: approximately 32 toasts, 2 cups onion marmalade

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds (about 4 medium/large) yellow onions, diced (about 4 ½ cups)
½ teaspoon salt
Pinch of sugar 
1 tablespoon Cognac, brandy, vermouth
1 cup low-sodium stock (your choice, I’ve used beef)
Freshly ground pepper
Long baguette, in ½ inch slices (about 32)
2 Cups grated Gruyère (about 8 ounces)

1.	Melt the butter and olive oil together in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions to the pan, toss them gently with the butter and oil, reduce the heat to medium or medium low and cover the pan
2.	Cook the onions for 15 minutes, then remove the lid, stir in the salt and sugar, and sauté without the lid for about 10-15 minutes until the onions are fully caramelized and are a deep golden color
3.	Pour in Cognac and stock, then turn heat all the way up and scrape any brown bits from the pan. Simmer the mixture until the broth almost completely disappears (a small amount of slosh is ok), about 5-10 minutes. Adjust the salt, if needed, and season with pepper
	If you’re doing this in advance,  save the mixture at room temperature for a few hours, or in the fridge in an airtight container. If in the fridge, rewarm gently when needed.
4.	Preheat oven to 375˚. Line two baking sheets with foil and bread slices. Dollop each round of bread with a tablespoon of the onion mixture (or whatever fits on the bread). Add 1 tablespoon of grated cheese to the top, mounding a bit to keep all in place.
5.	Bake the toasts for about 15 minutes, until bubbly and slightly browned. Serve immediately.
